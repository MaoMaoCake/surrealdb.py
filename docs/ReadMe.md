## Getting started
To get started install an instance of SurrealDB
The easiest way is to run it using docker using the following command  
### DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND IN PRODUCTION AS THIS GIVES ACCESS TO THE ROOT USER
```docker run --name surrealdb -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start --user root --pass root```
